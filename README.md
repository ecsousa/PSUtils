# PSUtils

**PSUtils has been discontinued!!**

It was a huge PowerShell, containing lots of unrelated scripts.  To keep thing
more organized and maintainable, it has been splitted into small modules, each
one containing related scripts:

* **[PSClip](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSClip)**: Clipboard manipulation
  functions
* **[PSColors](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSColors)**: Scripts for coloring
  prompt and file listings.
* **[PSCustomDrives](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSCustomDrives)**: Modules to
  help creating persistent PSDrives
* **[PSGnuwin32](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSGnuwin32)**: Collection of
  aliased gnuwin32 tools
* **[PSSudo](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSSudo)**: Function for executing
  programs with administrative privileges
* **[PSVSEnv](https://github.com/ecsousa/PSVSEnv)**: Functions for loading
  Visual Studio environment variables

These modules are also published to PowerShellGallery and PsGet repositories,
for easy installing in Windows 10, and for older versions with PsGet installed.
